FormGroup is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular, along with FormControl and FormArray.
A FormGroup aggregates the values of each child FormControl into one object, with each control name as the key. It calculates its status by reducing the 
status values of its children. For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire group becomes invalid
